Sentiment Analysis for Offense Detection using BERT and BiLSTM
This project aims to detect the sentiment of reviews as either offensive or not. It utilizes BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) for word embeddings and a Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM) model for sentiment analysis.

Overview
The project consists of several components:

Data Collection: The dataset used for training and testing the model. It typically consists of reviews labeled with their corresponding sentiment (offensive or not).

Preprocessing: Cleaning and preprocessing the data, including tokenization and padding.

Model Architecture:

BERT: Pre-trained model for word embeddings.
BiLSTM: Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory neural network for sentiment analysis.
Training: Training the sentiment analysis model using BERT embeddings and BiLSTM architecture.

Evaluation: Assessing the performance of the model using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

Web Interface: Connecting the trained model to a web interface using Flask, allowing users to input text and receive sentiment analysis results.

Dependencies
Ensure you have the following dependencies installed:

Python 3.x
TensorFlow
PyTorch
Transformers
Flask
You can install Python dependencies via pip:


Usage
Training:

Run train.py to train the sentiment analysis model using the provided dataset.
Adjust hyperparameters and model architecture as needed.
Web Interface:

Run app.py to start the Flask web server.
Access the web interface through your browser.
Customization:

Feel free to customize the model architecture, add additional preprocessing steps, or incorporate different embeddings/models based on your requirements.
Dataset
The dataset used for training and testing the model should be in a tabular format with at least two columns: one for the review text and another for the corresponding sentiment label (e.g., offensive or not).

Ensure the dataset is properly labeled and balanced to avoid bias in model training.
